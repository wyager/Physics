This is a circuit that converts TTL signals to ~30V signals.

We use it to drive a solenoid valve.

Parts are as follows:

2x 279-YR1B4K75CC    (~5K resistors)
1x 512-1N4002        (Flyback diode)
1x 71-CCF071K00JKE36 (~1K resistor)
1x 610-2N4401        (generic NPN transistor)
1x 610-2N4403        (generic PNP transistor)
1x 667-ECA-1HM330I   (50V smoothing cap)
